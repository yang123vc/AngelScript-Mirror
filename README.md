## Overview:
This is a mirror of the amazing AngelScript scripting library.
This mirrior contains version 2.33.0!

## ReadMe:

The AngelCode Scripting Library, or AngelScript as it is also known, is an extremely flexible cross-platform scripting library designed to allow applications to extend their functionality through external scripts. It has been designed from the beginning to be an easy to use component, both for the application programmer and the script writer.

Efforts have been made to let it call standard C functions and C++ methods with little to no need for proxy functions. The application simply registers the functions, objects, and methods that the scripts should be able to work with and nothing more has to be done with your code. The same functions used by the application internally can also be used by the scripting engine, which eliminates the need to duplicate functionality.

For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C/C++, but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks. Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C++ datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.

AngelScript is completely free, released under the zlib license.
